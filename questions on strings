1. What are escape characters?
A.
\n --> 	The new line character helps the programmer to insert a new line before or after a string.	
txt = “Guru\n99!”
print(txt)	
output:
Guru
99
\\ -->	This escape sequence allows the programmer to insert a backslash into the Python output.	
txt = “Guru\\99!”
print(txt)	
output:Guru\99!
\xhh--> 	Use a backslash followed by a hexadecimal number.
This is done by printing in backslash with the hexadecimal equivalent in double quotes.	
txt = “\x47\x75\x72\x75” + “99!”
print(txt)	
output:Guru99!
\ooo -->	To get the integer value of an octal value, provide a backslash followed by ooo or octal number in double-quotes.
It is done by printing in a backslash with three octal equivalents in double quotes.	
txt = ‘\107\125\122\125’+ “99!”
print(txt)	
output:GURU99!
\b -->	This escape sequence provides backspace to the Python string. It is inserted by adding a backslash followed by “b”.
“b” here represents backslash.
txt = “Guru\b99!”
print(txt)	
output:Gur99!
\f -->	It helps in the interpolation of literal strings	(interpolation:used to estimate unknown data point from known data points)
txt = “Guru\f99!”
print(txt)	
output:Guru99!
\r -->	It helps you to create a raw string	
txt = “Guru\r99!”
print(txt)	
output:99!
\’ -->	It helps you to add a single quotation to string	
txt = “Guru\’99!”
print(txt)	
output:Guru’99!


2. What do the \n and \t escape characters represent?
\n --> 	The new line character helps the programmer to insert a new line before or after a string.	
txt = “Guru\n99!”
print(txt)	
output:
Guru
99
\t --> it helps the programmer to create tab space between 2 strings
txt = “Guru\t99!”
print(txt)	
output:Guru	99!
