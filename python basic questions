1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
A. True & False are 2 Boolean data types.
   first letter in both the types  must be capital letter.
   
2. What are the three Boolean operators?
A.and,or,not are the three Boolean operators
  logical and boolean operators both are same.
  
3.Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
A.  inputs     and     or 
    0 0         0      0
    0 1         0      1
    1 0         0      1
    1 1         1      1
    
    not --> if we give input as 0 and it provides output as 1
            if we give input as 1 and it provides output as 0
            
            
4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)//False
not (5 > 4)//False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)//True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))//False
(True and True) and (True == False)//False
(not False) or (not True)//True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
A.>(greater than),<(less than),<=(less than or equal to),>=(greater than or equal to),==(equal to),!=(not equal to)

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
A.equal to operator is used for comparision two operands(it return 1 if True otherwise 0) 
  assignment operator is used to assign values to variables.(assign right side values to left variables)
