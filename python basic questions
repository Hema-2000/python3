1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
A. True & False are 2 Boolean data types.
   first letter in both the types  must be capital letter.
   
2. What are the three Boolean operators?
A.and,or,not are the three Boolean operators
  logical and boolean operators both are same.
  
3.Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
A.  inputs     and     or 
    0 0         0      0
    0 1         0      1
    1 0         0      1
    1 1         1      1
    
    not --> if we give input as 0 and it provides output as 1
            if we give input as 1 and it provides output as 0
            
            
4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)//False
not (5 > 4)//False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)//True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))//False
(True and True) and (True == False)//False
(not False) or (not True)//True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
A.>(greater than),<(less than),<=(less than or equal to),>=(greater than or equal to),==(equal to),!=(not equal to)

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
A.equal to operator is used for comparision two operands(it return 1 if True otherwise 0) 
  assignment operator is used to assign values to variables.(assign right side values to left variables) 
   
7.Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
spam=1
if(spam==1):
   print("Hello")
elif(spam==2):
   print("Howdy")
else:
   print("Greetings")
   
   
8. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
A.ctrl+c


9.What is the difference between break and continue?
A. break: it alters the flow of loop when condition satisfies
   continue: it skip the statements with in the loop if condition satisfies
   
   
10. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
A.all are same it provvides 0 to 9

11.Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
# for i in range(0,11):
#     print(i)
i=0
while(i<11):
    print(i)
    i+=1
    
    
12.If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
A.spam.bacon()


13.what is round() function
A.it return floating point number that is rounded version of specifies number with specified number of decimals.the default number of decimal is zero.
print(round(23.6))//24
# when the (ndigit+1)th digit is =5
print(round(2.665, 2))//2.67

# when the (ndigit+1)th digit is >=5
print(round(2.676, 2))//2.68

# when the (ndigit+1)th digit is <5
print(round(2.673, 2))//2.67
  
  
14.what is abs() function
A.this function is used to return a absolute value of given num.it takes only one argument
  that argument may be a int, float and complex num if argument is complex num then it return magnitude of it.
print(abs(-35))//35
print(abs(-9.34))//9.34
print(abs(4-5j))//magnitude(sqrt(a^2+b^2))6.4o3
